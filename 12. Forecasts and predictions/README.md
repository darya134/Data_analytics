# 12. Churn prediction for fitness centers

## Task

In this project, I prepared recommendations for retaining customers based on an analysis of customer profiles.

Based on the analysis, I made a conclusion that:
- Our target audience:
    - Local residents;
    - Those who are over 30.

Need to attract customers with:
    - more profitable affiliate programs and promotions;
    - more profitable subscriptions for 12 months;
    - a variety of group activities;
    - encouraging customers to visit the gym more than twice a week.
