# 08. Testing hypotheses to increase revenue in an online store

## Status
Completed

## Task

In this project, I prioritized hypotheses developed together with a large online store's marketing department. Also, ran A/B test and analyzed the results. 

## Conclusion

Prioritization of hypotheses:

- Applied the ICE framework to prioritize hypotheses. Hypotheses number 8 has the highest priority in the ICE framework.
- Applied the RICE framework to prioritize hypotheses. Hypotheses number 7 has the highest priority in the ICE framework.
The parameter (Reach) used in the RICE framework changed the entire priority obtained by the ICE framework, only 6 and 4 hypotheses remained in the same places.

The test results revealed:

- For both "raw" and "clean" data, there were statistically significant differences in the conversion of groups A and B. For "raw" data, the relative change of group "B" was 17.4%, and for "clean" it was 13.8%.

- Both "raw" and "clean" data showed no statistically significant difference in average check for groups A and B. For "raw" data, group B had a relative change of 26%, while for "clean", it had a relative growth of -2%. The anomalous order No. 425 for 1.3 million explains the -2% for "clean".

The test can therefore be stopped and group B recorded as the winner. Group B was much more effective in terms of conversion than group A, even though the average check is about the same between the two groups.
