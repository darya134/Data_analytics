## Dataset

The following data was used:

## Task

The entertainment application has consistently lost money over the past few months - a lot of money has been spent trying to attract users, but it hasn't worked. You as a marketing analyst need to understand the reasons behind this. A server log containing information on application visits by new users registered between 2019-05-01 and 2019-10-27, as well as statistics on advertising costs, is available to you.
