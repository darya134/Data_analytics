## Task

The entertainment application has consistently lost money over the past few months - a lot of money has been spent trying to attract users, but it hasn't worked. In this project, I as a marketing analyst needed to understand the reasons behind this. A server log containing information on application visits by new users registered between 2019-05-01 and 2019-10-27, as well as statistics on advertising costs, is available.

As a result of this analysis, I made a conclusion:

- Pay attention to Mac and iPhone owners. The cost of their attraction is increasing each month, and their ROI is suffering. The company can make some interesting marketing offer for owners of these devices so that they pay off more.

- Pay attention to US users. Users from the US make up the majority of our users, but there is a high cost of user acquisition, and it is growing, along with the lowest return on advertising. In order to encourage users to spend money, advertising needs to be better or marketing offers need to be more interesting. It is also important to determine what caused the drop in user payback since June 2019.

- The best results are seen in England and Germany. Perhaps you should target these ausiences more.

- The cost of attracting users via the TipTop advertising channel is constantly increasing, but the expense does not pay off. It may be worthwhile to reduce the budget allocated to this network and redirect it to one that is more efficient.

- Adnonsense, FaceBoom, TipTop channels do not pay off. By October, TipTop was approaching 650 spends, while FaceBoom was approaching 300. Aside from FaceBoom and Adnonsense, the rest of the acquisition channels are quite cheap and have a higher ROI. Paying users from FaceBoom and Adnonsense are poorly retained. The company can try to purchase traffic from cheaper, but profitable channels.
