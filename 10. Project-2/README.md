# 10. An analysis of user behavior in a mobile application


## Dataset

The following data was used:

Each entry in the log is a user action or event.

* event name 
* device id
* event timestamp 
* group (246 and 247 — control groups, 248 — experimental group)

## Task

Analyze the sales funnel and the results of an A/A/B test. We need to understand how food startup users behave a mobile application. We agreed to make a decision based on the results of an A/A/B test after the designers wanted to change fonts throughout the application. To determine which font is the most effective, users were divided into three groups: two control groups with old fonts, and one experimental group with new fonts. Two control groups have certain advantages. If the two control groups are equal, the test can be assumed to be accurate. In the case where the two control groups differ significantly, the causes of the distortion can be identified.
