# 03. Apartments for sale — real estate market analysis

## Status
Completed

## Task

In this project, I set the parameters for determining the market value of real estate using an archive of advertisements for apartments that have been for sale for several years. 

## Conclusion

I made a conclusion that:

- In general, there are 1, 2, and 3 bedroom apartments on the market, which have an area of less than 100 square meters, ceiling heights ranging from 2.5 to 3 meters and cost about 6 million.

- The average apartment is sold in 95 days. If it sells in less than 45 days, it is fast, but if it sells in more than 200 days, it is slow.

- In general, the price of an apartment is determined more by the size of the apartment than the number of rooms. The price of an apartment on the first floor is much more affordable than the other options. Also, apartments on the top floor are cheaper than the others, except for the first apartment on the top floor.

- St. Petersburg has the highest average cost per square meter.

- Compared to the city as a whole, apartments in the center (the border of the central zone is 7km or less) have an average area of 15 meters.

- Apartments in the center are much more expensive than in the city. On average, the cost 2.7-3.4 million.

- In the center, the price is most dependent on the total area and then on the number of rooms and floors. Distance from the center has little effect on the prices.

- The first floor in the center is much cheaper than the other options, and the top floor is almost the same price as the other floors.
