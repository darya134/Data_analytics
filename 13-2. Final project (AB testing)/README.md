# 13-2. Evaluating the results of an A/B test  

## Status
Complete

## Task

In this project, I tested the effectiveness of the new online store recommendation system. Evaluated the correctness of the A/B test and analyzed the results using a dataset with user actions, a technical task, and several auxiliary datasets.

## Conclusion

After evaluating the results of A / B testing:

The results of A/B testing with Bonferroni adjustment showed that the conversion rates of groups A and B have statistically significant differences at the product_page stage. At the product_cart and purchase stages, the conversion rates of groups A and B do not have statistically significant differences.

I made a conclusion that the A/B test should be rerun considering any data issues.
