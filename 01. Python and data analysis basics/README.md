## Task

In this project, I tested three hypotheses:
1. Users in two cities listen to music differently on different days of the week;
2. Certain genres predominate in Moscow on Monday mornings, whereas others predominate in St. Petersburg. Similarly, Friday evenings vary by city in terms of genre.
3. Rap is the most popular genre in St. Petersburg. Moscow is dominated by pop music.

I conlcuded that the day of the week has a different effect on the activity of users in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

The analysis supports the first hypothesis that users in two cities listen to music differently on different days of the week:
- Listening peaks in Moscow on Mondays and Fridays, and declines on Wednesdays;
- Listening peaks in St. Petersburg on Wednesdays, and declines on Mondays and Fridays.

The second hypothesis was partially supported. It states that certain genres predominate in Moscow on Monday mornings, whereas others predominate in St. Petersburg. Similarly, Friday evenings vary by city in terms of genre:
- Users listen to similar music at the beginning and at the end of the week;
- There is not much difference between Moscow and St. Petersburg.

The third hypothesis was partially supported. It states that rap is the most popular genre in St. Petersburg. Moscow is dominated by pop music.:
- Pop music is the most popular genre in Moscow;
- Pop music is also the most popular genre in St.
