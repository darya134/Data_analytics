# 01. User comparison between two cities

## Task

In this project I tested three hypotheses:
1. Users in two cities listen to music differently on different days of the week;
2. Certain genres predominate in Moscow on Monday mornings, whereas others predominate in St. Petersburg. Similarly, Friday evenings vary by city in terms of genre.
3. Rap is the most popular genre in St. Petersburg. Moscow is dominated by pop music.
