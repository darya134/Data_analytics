# 05. Studying the patterns that determine the success of games

## Status
Completed

## Task

In order to bid on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns for an online retailer of computer games, I identified patterns that determine its success using historical data on computer game sales, user and expert ratings, genres, and platforms.  

## Conclusion

Based on the data analysis performed:
- it is best to sell games from such platforms as Sony Playstation 4;
- genre must be chosen Shooter;
- the rating must be chosen "from 17 years old".

This will help increase sales significantly.
