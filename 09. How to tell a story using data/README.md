## Status
Complete

## Task

In this project, I conducted a market research of catering establishments using open data. Determined the prospects of opening a network of catering establishments, their type, number of seats, and location.  

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis of the data, recommendations can be made that:
- It is best to open cafes and restaurants, since these establishments are the most popular and they are more likely to get chain distribution.
- In choosing the number of seats, you should consider the following figures: cafe - 30, restaurant - 80.
- It is recommended to choose a location from the top 10 streets: Prospect Mira, Profsoyuznaya street, Leningradsky prospect, Presnenskaya embankment, Varshavskoye highway, Leninsky prospect, Vernadsky prospect, Kutuzovsky prospect, Kashirskoye highway, Kirovogradskaya street.
