# 13-1. User segmentation based on behavior - mobile app analysis

## Status
Completed

## Task

To improve the mobile application, I analyzed user actions in the application, studied insights, and divided users into groups with different metrics.  

## Conclusion

After user segmentation, I made a conclusion:

- By clustering users into groups, it is possible to find the two leader groups (2 and 3) from their contacts_show per user. These groups have very few users, but they utilize the application to its full potential;
- The highest conversion rate was in group 2 (62%);
- Group 2 has the highest retention rate, perhaps because users like to search for things on their own.

The ad serving system needs to be improved. Users see ads in all search engines, but are not interested in looking at photos or even contacts. Users are not shown what is relevant them. It is necessary to find out what interests them and build algorithms based on this information.
